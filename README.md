## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Gonzalo — but online, I go by **Deeprat**.  
Data Scientist. AI Engineer.  
Unofficial lab rodent of the digital world.

When I was 6, *Cosmos* by Carl Sagan landed in my hands. I didn’t choose it — it just fell into my life like a prophecy.  
Since then, I’ve sprinted through every branch of science with the energy of a child hopped up on **multiple Red Bulls**:  
physics, biology, mathematics, psychology, philosophy. If it had structure, I wanted to tear it apart and understand it.

Eventually, I found my true home: **artificial intelligence**.  
My curiosity had found its perfect outlet. I could spend endless hours programming, analyzing data, building models, and trying to make machines do what humans barely understand.

This is where my obsessions collide:  
**learning**, **building**, **trying to comprehend the incomprehensible**...  
Or at least, training an AI to fake it convincingly.

## ✨ Work Philosophy

I work compulsively — not out of pressure, but because I love what I do and quitting has never been an option.  
Every problem is an invitation to dive deeper. Challenges don’t wear me down; they wind me up.

I value both the result *and* the process. I learn constantly, and I apply what I learn obsessively.  
To me, code isn't just execution — it's exploration, iteration, and the art of building systems that think, adapt, and improve.

The work never truly ends. That’s the point.

## 💡 A Note on This Repository

Everything you’ll find here is meant to be **explored, learned from, shared, and adapted**.  
The tools, code, and experiments are built using open or freely available resources — with education and experimentation in mind.

If something here helps you build, break, or understand something better, then it’s doing its job.
