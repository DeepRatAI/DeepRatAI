## 💡 About This Repository

This isn't a static portfolio.  
This is my lab. My journal. My sandbox.

A place to document experiments, code, benchmarks, architectures, breakthroughs — and sometimes breakdowns.  
Everything here is fueled by obsession, crafted from scratch, and tested in the wild (often with caffeine, sometimes with existential dread).

If it helps you learn, build, debug, or question something better — mission accomplished.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Gonzalo — but online, I go by **DeepRat**.

I’m an **Engineer in Artificial Intelligence, Software and Systems**, trained formally and shaped obsessively by practice.  
From backend APIs and retrieval architectures, to agents that analyze language and intent, I build systems that think, connect, and explain.

When I was 6, a book fell into my hands like a prophecy:  
**Cosmos**, by Carl Sagan.

Since that day, I’ve been running through every branch of science — physics, psychology, philosophy, biology, math — not out of duty, but compulsion.  
If it had structure, I wanted to break it open and understand how it breathed.

Eventually, I found a domain where I could apply **everything I knew, loved, and questioned**: artificial intelligence.  
And from there, I never stopped building.

## 🧠 What I Do

### 🧩 I design and build intelligent systems
- 🤖 **TrueEye** — Media Literacy AI that analyzes news for bias, audience and intent.
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Systems** — RAG pipelines with reasoning, memory, and task delegation.
- 📚 **Educational Tools** — Like Mole, a bilingual chatbot that learns your documents.
- 🧪 **Model Benchmarks** — Comparative tests on LLM performance, latency, semantic accuracy.
- 🧬 **Conceptual Prototypes** — Like ConCiencia, a philosophical AI project exploring self-awareness.

---

### 🔧 I operate across the full stack of intelligence

**From concept to production** — I don’t just contribute parts.  
I take raw ideas and shape them into deployable systems: I architect, code, integrate, optimize, and launch.  
From backend APIs to RAG agents, from embeddings to fine-tuning, from prompt to product — I do it all, end-to-end.

---

### ✨ I Design
- Prompt engineering frameworks, reasoning trees, and agent workflows  
- Modular RAG pipelines with semantic search, hybrid routing, multi-agent delegation and memory  
- Multimodal architectures integrating text, vision, audio, and user context  
- Tools that explain, contextualize, and adapt to real-world information  

---

### 🧱 I Build
- API backends using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and tool-integrated logic  
- Agents powered by **open models** (LLaMA, Phi, Granite, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.), **Claude**, **GPT-4**, **Cohere**, via **Ollama**, **Transformers**, or direct API  
- Embedding engines with **MiniLM**, **Instructor**, **Specter2**, **CLIP**, **GTE**, custom ST models  
- Vector pipelines using **FAISS**, **Chroma**, hybrid retrievers and semantic chunking  
- Local inference setups with **Ollama**, **GGUF**, **AutoGPTQ**, and quantized adapters  
- Tool-based reasoning using **ToolCalling**, **LangGraph agents**, custom toolkits  
- Interfaces and apps built with **Gradio**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, and **Tailwind**  

---

### 🧪 I Train & Fine-Tune
- LoRA and **QLoRA** fine-tuning pipelines on **Colab A100** and **local Ollama**  
- Adapter-based optimization using **PEFT**, **Transformers**, and **bitsandbytes**  
- Training-ready scripts for model personalization, RAG adaptation and instructional tuning  
- Quantized model deployment via **GGUF**, **4-bit inference**, **bitsandbytes**, and **AutoGPTQ**  

---

### 🚀 I Deploy
- Live demos, APIs, and production apps on:
  - **Hugging Face Spaces** (with Gradio or FastAPI)  
  - **Google Cloud Platform (VMs with L4 GPU or T4)**  
  - **Local Linux servers via SSH**, or containerized apps  
- End-to-end architecture: from notebook to backend, from raw data to running app

## 💬 Final Note

Everything I build is modular, reproducible, and functional —  
**Not just notebooks. Not just demos. Real systems built to think, adapt, and run.**
